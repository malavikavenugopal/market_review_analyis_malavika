Review,
Love the food...Do not have any complaints!!! Favorite item to order stuffed mushrooms,
Food is delicious and fresh! Many options to choose from including veggie. Service is a little slow but it's good. Take time to make the food home made. Reasonable prices.,
"t was absolutely the best , atmosphere was great the food was fantastic , our waiter was cute to lol",
Really great pizza pie! The service was good and the food was also good.,
"The special was Tortellini with Pesto sauce & Shrimp, and it was sublime!  Creamy pesto sauce, with plump perfectly cooked shrimps, (tails on, but not a deterrent!), and cheese tortellinis that melt in your mouth",
Best gnocchi ever!,
A definite five stars for the pizza and their classic appetizers! ,
Way way way over-rated! I stopped going here after a few lousy meals and bad attitudes.,
"The chicken was so dry and the alfredo sauce wasn't that great. We heard that the pizza was spectacular but what we tasted was just okay. The only good thing was the waiter, he was really nice.",
"Food : we ordered the chicken Alfredo pizza , mussels and Linguini ! The mussels were steamed with white wine , butter and garlic ! However, although they were flavorful , they did not taste very fresh. ",
"the manicotti is made with a homemade crepe instead of pasta. You barely have to chew at all, as it melts seamlessly into the ricotta and mozarella cheeses. I recommend ordering it with meat sauce. ",
"Real deep dish pan pizza Chicago style, worth fighting for. I called it in before I left the house and it was ready when we got there, best pizza ever, nice people good food no fourty five minute wait for seating and the rest of the menu is tops also. ",
Fantastico!! I had the manicotti and it was mouth watering. My friend had there  lasagna and it was to die for. H,
The stuffed pizza is excellent!  ,
Amazing pasta and meatballs. I was so happy to stop here after a long day of hiking,
"Their pizzas are good, their spaghetti not so much. Service takes forever and the place is filthy and loud. ",
"Love this place! Super friendly staff and the pizza is delicious. I love the deep dish meat lovers, its a diamond in the rough!",
"Not too pretty on the eyes but great Italian food (I'm Italian), huge portions, and good prices!",
This place is famous for their deep dish pizza for a reason it is yummy! I tried their chicken caccatore and their chicken parm they were ok but their pizza is the best!,
"The only good dish I have had here was the pizza. I've tried the fettuccine Alfredo, which had absolutely no taste to it. The lasagne was ok...I've had better at Olive Garden and many other places. ",
"The lasagna was great!!  When it comes to lasagna, I definitely like some meat and don't want the ricotta cheese to overpower the entire dish.  It was very good and the spices they add really made it great! ",
